# my-links
Welcome to `my-links` for `links.dev`, a repo for individuals to customize their page on links.dev

To use this repo, follow these steps:

- Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.

- In the root directory of the repo, update the "page.json". This file should contain the data for your link in bio page, such as the links you want to include, the titles for each link, and any other relevant information.

- Update the file called "custom.css" in the same directory. This file will be used to customize the look and feel of your link in bio page. You can use this file to add your own styles, such as fonts, colors, and layout.

- Once you have created/updated your page.json and custom.css files, you can view your link in bio page by visiting the URL for your forked repo. For example, if your username is "johnsmith", the URL for your link in bio page would be https://links.dev/johnsmith

If you want to make changes to your link in bio page, simply update your page.json and custom.css files, commit the changes to your repo, and refresh the page to see the updates.

Happy customizing!
