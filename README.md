# my-links for links.dev

## Do not open a PR or an issue! Instead fork this or create your own `my-links` repo. 
This is my personal `my-links` repo. You need your own.

## Welcome to `my-links`
a repo for individuals to customize their page on links.dev

### To use this repo, follow these steps

- Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.

- In the root directory of the repo, update the "page.json". This file should contain the data for your link in bio
  page, such as the links you want to include, the titles for each link, and any other relevant information.

- Update the file called "custom.css" in the same directory. This file will be used to customize the look and feel of
  your link in bio page. You can use this file to add your own styles, such as fonts, colors, and layout.

- Once you have created/updated your page.json and custom.css files, you can view your link in bio page by visiting the
  URL for your forked repo. For example, if your username is "fatih", the URL for your link in bio page would
  be https://links.dev/fatih

- If you want to invalidate the cache after you update your page, hit your page with refresh parameter, like
  this: https://links.dev/fatih?refresh=1

If you want to make changes to your link in bio page, simply update your page.json and custom.css files, commit the
changes to your repo, and refresh the page to see the updates.

Happy customizing!
